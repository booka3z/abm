# Agent-based Modeling
This is where we keep track of useful information as we build out our agent-based model for natural gas trading market


Here we focus on the methodological advancement of agent-based modeling.
Our own pain is the difficulty to develope a model with predictive power in the natural gas market. We are looking for tools that can help us to conduct computational experiements and also tools that can connect with reality. When we say connect to reality, it means we can pull our observations in the real world and leverage those data to calibrate our model. We think the potential is in building better programming, visualization, and validation tools.
